# Predicting_House_Prices
Based on Machine Learning - Linear Regression Model

1. I have used the already present California Housing dataset in the sklearn library 
2. There are 8 features in the Housing Dataset on which we will apply Linear Regression Model of Supervised Machine Learning to predict the house prices
3. Supervised Machine learning is where we have a target value
4. Linear Regression is a Regression Model in which we have taregt values that can be any whole number
